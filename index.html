  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Terrance Larkin and I am excited to share the beginning stages of my programming career with you.
    I currently reside in the Rough Valley in Southern Oregon, specifically Medford, OR. I moved to the
    area in February from Phoenix, AZ. I lived in Phoenix, AZ for 6 years, but I was orginally born and raised in
    South Bend, IN.</p>

  <p>Moving to Southern Oregon was one of the best things I've done. One of the main reasons is all of the activities
    that one can experience in nature. I am an outside kind of guy so being in this area is dream come true.
    Here is a list of some of my favorite things to do:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Golfing</li>
    <li>Weight lifting</li>
    <li>Hiking</li>
    <li>Snowboarding</li>
    <li>Wine tasting</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Career History</h2>
  <p>I gradutated from Indiana State University in 2010 with a communitcations degree. I was a basketball player in college
    and I had an opprotunity to play professionally overseas for 4 years. After basketball, I worked in finance as an underwriter
    for 9 years. Due to the lack of growth in the finance world, I decided to look for a career change, and landed on programming
    and web devlopment.
  </p>

  <p>I am extremely excited about my future in programming. Here are a list of projects that I have
    been working on so far:
