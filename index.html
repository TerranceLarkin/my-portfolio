    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Terrance Larkin and I am excited to share the beginning stages of my programming career with you.
      I currently reside in the Rough Valley in Southern Oregon, specifically Medford, OR. I moved to the
      area in February from Phoenix, AZ. I lived in Phoenix, AZ for 6 years, but I was orginally born and raised in
      South Bend, IN.</p>

    <p>Moving to Southern Oregon was one of the best things I've done. One of the main reasons is all of the activities
      that one can experience in nature. I am an outside kind of guy so being in this area is dream come true.
      Here is a list of some of my favorite things to do:<img src="img/me2.JPG" class="left">
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Golfing</li>
      <li>Weight lifting</li>
      <li>Hiking</li>
      <li>Snowboarding</li>
      <li>Wine tasting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Career History</h2>
    <p>I gradutated from Indiana State University in 2010 with a communitcations degree. I was a basketball player in college
      and I had an opprotunity to play professionally overseas for 4 years. After basketball, I worked in finance as an underwriter
      for 9 years. Due to the lack of growth in the finance world, I decided to look for a career change, and landed on programming
      and web devlopment.
    </p>

    <p>I am <em>extremely excited</em> about my future in programming. The first project is about some of the cool places I've been
      to. It also has a few images of my top sites. The second project is a page dedicated to my pets. This page also has images of my
      beautiful babies. Both project languages are HTML. Here are a list of projects that I have
      been working on so far:
